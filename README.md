# Chess.com Spanish Voice Commentary (simplified)

This project is a fork from https://github.com/renshenw/chesscom-voice-simplified .

I adapted it to spanish language. Only supports Chess.com in spanish (due to adaptation to notation, for example Nc3, in spanish would be Cc3).
I added overlap time between sound tracks so the move doesn't take too long to be announced.
